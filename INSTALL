Building numactl
----------------

    TL;DR:

      $ ./configure
      $ make
      # make install

    Start by configuring the build running the configure script:

      $ ./configure

    You can pass options to configure to define build options, to pass it
    compiler paths, compiler flags and to define the installation layout. Run
    "./configure --help" for more details on how to customize the build.

    Once build is completed, build numactl with:

      $ make

    If you would like to increase verbosity by printing the full build command
    lines, pass "make" the V=1 parameter:

      $ make V=1

    You can run the tests included with numactl with the following command:

      $ make check

    The results will be saved in test/*.log files and a test-suite.log will be
    generated with the summary of test passes and failures.

    Install numactl to the system by running the following command as root:

      # make install

    You can also install it to a staging directory, in which case it is not
    required to be root while running the install steps. Just pass a DESTDIR
    variable while running "make install" with the path to the staging
    directory.

      $ make install DESTDIR=/path/to/staging/numactl


Using a snapshot from the Git repository

    First, the build system files need to be generated using the ./autogen.sh
    script, which calls autoreconf with the appropriate options to generate the
    configure script and the templates for Makefile, config.h, etc.

    Once those files are generated, follow the normal steps to configure and
    build numactl.

    In order to create a distribution tarball, use "make dist" from a
    configured build tree. Use "make distcheck" to confirm that rebuilding from
    the distribution archive works as expected, that building from out-of-tree
    works, that test cases pass, etc.
